<h1><u>Twitter Sentiment Analysis Classifier</u></h1>
The notebook focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using the twitter sentiment analysis dataset. The goal for this project was to predict sentiment of tweets, understand what factors affect the tweet sentiments and implement NLP techniques in order to get optimal results.

The notebook follows a structured ML workflow:

Data Cleaning – handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – class imbalance analysis, sentiment type distribution.

Feature Engineering – categorical encoding, removal of redundant features.

Modeling – trained Extra Trees Classifier due to its increased randomness in splitting nodes and selecting features reduces model variance and the risk of overfitting..

Evaluation – Confusion matrix, Classification metrics, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
